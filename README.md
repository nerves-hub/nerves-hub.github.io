# www.nerves-hub.org

This is the source for the NervesHub project home page at https://www.nerves-hub.org/.

The `main` branch of this repo contains the raw source of the site and should be the target for all changes.

During development, you can generate a preview of the site with `npm run watch`. To view the output, open `_dist/index.html` in your web browser.

Any time `main` is updated via pull request, CI will rebuild the site and push updates to the `gh-pages` branch, which will then be served by GitHub Pages.
